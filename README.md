# getting-and-cleaning-data-project
Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Module

This repository contains the script (run_analysis.R) and documentation files for this project. 

The script does the following ;
  - creates a directory, if not exists, download the source file and extract
  - Merges the dataset, extract the measurement on mean and standard deviation 
  - Label the dataset appropriately, converts the data into factors
  - Finally creates a tidy dataset that has the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity
